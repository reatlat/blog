Logitech Mouse Model M-RCQ142 White was purchased by mistake =) I wanted to buy the same black but mistakenly bought white =)

The mouse is excellent and comfortable and worked flawlessly for 3 years, but lately ... left mouse button has become a sticky!

Today I received a package from AliExpress OMRON new buttons for my Logitech mouse.

To repair it took me not more than 5 minutes and a cup of coffee =)

Now, the mouse works just like new! I must say the left button works much quieter than the right(original).
