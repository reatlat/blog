At the end of 2015 I decided to go out from Arch Linux to Ubuntu Linux.

2016 year I start with Ubuntu.

It was a painfull, after clean and simple Arch but I trying something new.

I love Unity UI but Maybe it was my ZenBook2 or my curvers hands :) All time with Ubuntu 14.04 and after April 16.04 I have a lot of issues and crushes.

My Upwork Team App work incorect and sometimes crashed.
Also Unity eat a lot of RAM (my book have only 4Gb)

Actualy for some reason I have a lot of porblem after my ubuntu install new updates.

Why I move to ubuntu???
- I think Ubuntu easy to day2day work
- I have a plan buy new laptop (ZenBook2) and use new linux (linux-experemnt)
- More stabilty with Canonical.

In finaly I have linux like Windows =)

Arch linux not for beginners, but if you start explore Arch family you never back to Debian family or other...

Devil is in the details ...
