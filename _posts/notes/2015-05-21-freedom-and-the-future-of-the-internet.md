Often there are articles and publications on the issue of spying on the Internet. Then briefly thought about trying to use the program for encoding messages and information flow. And finally she calmed down. The reason appeared one and the same thought: I have nothing to hide.

But yesterday I read a book by [Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet][0]. And this book has allowed me to open my eyes to what is happening in the world.Here are a few quotes.

> And it’s[surveillance] totalizing now, because people put all their political ideas, their family communications, and their friendships on to the internet.

Julian compares the Internet tubes. And points to the fact that every person has the opportunity to install these pipes cameras and microphones. 

> To explain it roughly historically, in the old days someone was a target because of his diplomatic position, because of the company he worked for, because he was suspected of doing something or he was in contact with people who actually did something, and then you applied surveillance measures on him. These days it’s deemed much more efficient to say, “We’ll take everything and we can sort it out later.” So they do have long-term storage...

Even poor countries can not afford the equipment for the total collection and preservation of information on the Internet. 

> It’s the efficiency of understanding and responding to what’s being intercepted and stored that’s going to be the next big leap.

The book was written in 2012, the technology is evolving very quickly. And I think the authorities already have all the necessary tools to process incoming information.

> And even if you’re dealing with evil countries and you bring them surveillance equipment to do evil things you will benefit, because you will learn what they are listening to, what are they afraid of, who are the most important people in the country opposing the government, organizing political events and so on. So you will be able to predict future happenings, to sponsor actions and so on.

Here are revealed the main reasons for which this is done. The authorities are well aware of the opposition, as they receive information about what citizens think about the powerful people. And it allows them to respond to the subtle signals, giving a piece of information in the media, or to use more serious methods.

Statistical data is power!

> So people will have to think about it.

> The only question is in which one of the two ways will they think about it? They will either think, “I need to be careful about what I say, I need to conform,” the whole time, in every interaction. Or they will think “I need to master little components of this technology and install things that protect me so I’m able to express my thoughts freely and communicate freely with my friends and people I care about.” If people don’t take that second step then we’ll have a universal political correctness, because even when people are communicating with their closest friends they will be self-censors and will remove themselves as political actors from the world.

Leave without comment.

> The liberty of freedom of movement, physical freedom of movement—your ability to travel from one place to another, to not have armed force deployed against you. We can think about the liberty of freedom of thought, and freedom of communication, which is inherently wrapped up in freedom of thought—if there’s a threat against you for speaking publicly, the only way to safeguard your right to communicate is to communicate privately
This is the only thing that has not controlled by the government.
It is Orwell’s dictum, “He who controls the present controls the past and he who controls the past controls the future.”
History rewritten rewrite and still be rewritten. Only now, for this purpose, even our own thoughts, presented in a certain way ...

### P.S.:

Do the world a future in a time when it is under the supervision of Big Brother? I have no answer to this question. Just as there is no answer to the question how to get rid of global surveillance.

Julian, in his book are the two methods to solve the problem with the observation:

- Technology (use of cryptographic software and open source)
- Political (introduction of legislation restricting the pursuit)

Based on the news, we can say that there is no political solution. A maintenance will allow to carry out a confidential communication between a group of persons.
And nothing more.
