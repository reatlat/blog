Hello world!

It is something I most tell you all, I can not speak english so good and the reason is that I live in Spain (Catalunya) and speak spanish and catalan, with my friends and with people I meet.

But at home I speak russian because I actually come from Russia.

Four languages are not so much but it is extra difficult to learn new.

So i hope you understand me and I wanna do my best to be good.

If I have grammatical wrong, spell wrong or something else please tell me and correct me.

Because I want from all my heart to learn english and speak with that language that all the world understand (not all but the most).
