I recently made the move from [Blogger][0] to [Jekyll][1], hosted on [Github Pages][2]. It was a pretty pleasant conversion too, as Jekyll has a good amount of documenation and support.

### Why I chose Jekyll
For years Blogger hasn’t really kept up for years with the modern web, so I finally gave up on it and moved to Jekyll. Here are some of the reasons for why I chose Jekyll.

- I didn’t need a user interface to write blog posts. Git and markdown is sufficient.
- I wanted to own my own data.
- I wanted more control on customizing the look and feel of the site.
- I didn’t want to pay money for any hosting.

### Jekyll begins
