Hi my name is Alexander or as my friends call me just Alex! I'm Geek that enjoys solving problems, technology, software development, food, reading, photography, blogging, and traveling.

I've been blessed in my career to work on large scale projects in the US, Spain, Australia, and Russia.
I'm multilingual and speak free on English, Spanish, Catalan, Russian, also I understand a basic French and Italian. I love to learn new languages.

Currently I live in beautiful and sunny Barcelona, with my [amazing wife][0], and son. If you have a coding challenge, please reach out!
